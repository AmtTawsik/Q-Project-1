Next JS and Nuxt JS are both popular frameworks for building server-side rendered (SSR) React and Vue applications respectively. Here are some key differences between the two:

1. Language: Next JS is built on top of React, whereas Nuxt JS is built on top of Vue. If you prefer working with React, then Next JS might be a better fit for you. If you prefer working with Vue, then Nuxt JS might be a better fit.

2. Configuration: Next JS requires less configuration than Nuxt JS. Next JS has a "zero-config" option that allows you to get up and running quickly without having to worry about configuring things like Webpack. Nuxt JS, on the other hand, has more configuration options, which can make it more flexible but also more complex.

3. Routing: Next JS has a file-based routing system that makes it easy to create new pages. Nuxt JS also has a file-based routing system, but it's more flexible and allows you to create nested routes and dynamic routes more easily.

4. Server-side rendering: Both Next JS and Nuxt JS are designed to make server-side rendering easy. However, Next JS is better suited for static sites and Nuxt JS is better suited for dynamic sites. Next JS can generate a static version of your site that can be served from a CDN, whereas Nuxt JS is better at handling dynamic data.

5. Plugins: Nuxt JS has a plugin system that makes it easy to add functionality to your application. Next JS does not have a plugin system, but it does have a large ecosystem of third-party packages that you can use to extend its functionality.

In summary, both Next JS and Nuxt JS are excellent frameworks for building server-side rendered applications, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. If you prefer React and want a simpler configuration process, then Next JS might be the better choice. If you prefer Vue and want more flexibility in your routing and server-side rendering, then Nuxt JS might be the better choice.
